		<h2>
			Python + Bash, The ultimate combo?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Python is one of the most famous, useful and awesome programming language out there.
			It's applications are almost everywhere in our modern world. And then there is bash
			which is the linux shell language. We can do many stuffs in our os using bash
			and when we combine bash with python, we get really awesome results. One example I
			made is a secured diary using gnupg as encryption which is absolutely one of the safest thing possible.

			Telegram - A piracy hub or Great community?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Telegram is one of the safest and the best texting app available as of now. It comes with great security, great and flexible api, and cloud storage support. Using these advantages, many people have made it a piracy hub, Movies, music, games, web series, and anything you can imagine is straight away available over there. Telegram is often blamed to be a piracy hub because of this. But if we see there are great communities over there too, which are a lot famous than the piracy channels... Communities like gaming, android development, custom roms, device groups are very famous and it has became very easy to distribute custom roms because of telegram...
			So even if piracy is there, it's has a lot useful stuff as well, it just depends on how you use it.
