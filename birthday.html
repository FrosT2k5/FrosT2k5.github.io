			I didnt have much time to work hard on this but whatever I am writing here is coming directly from my heart, I hope you like it :)<br><br>

			It's been more than a year since we are friends, and a friend like you is impossible to find, I would had stop making roms for sakura long ago but I didnt want to loose a good friend like you so I kept going. We never really seen each other (I hope one day we will meet in person, I belive that will happen) but still the bond between us is very strong. I hope that you will have a long and a really happy & exciting life :)<br><br>

			~ Your Friend, FrosT
